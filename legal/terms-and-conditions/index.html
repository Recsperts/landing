Any refunds must be requested by emailing support@recspert.com within thirty (30) days of the charge. We might issue a refund for the following situations: The project changed significantly. If a Customer contacts you about an opportunity that’s drastically different from the original Lead (for example, the Customer changes the location, and it’s outside of your travel area), let us know what changed when you request a refund.\nThe opportunity is unreasonable. If you were contacted by a Customer who needs something you can’t reasonably accommodate or do, you may request a refund.\nThe Customer’s first contact is “no thanks.” When you reach out to Customers, we don’t think it’s fair for you to pay if the Customer’s first response back to you is a clear no. But if you were charged for this situation, request a refund and we’ll look into it.\nA Lead violates our Terms of Use. We do our best to make sure all Leads meet our terms and guidelines. If you get a Lead that doesn’t meet these Terms of Use, please report the Customer to request a refund.\nThe opportunity takes place outside of your availability.

a. Automatic refunds</p><p>In some circumstances, we will automatically issue a refund back to a Recspert’s Account. The Recspert doesn&rsquo;t need to contact us or request a refund for these. They include:</p><p>Booking protection. if a Customer books a Recspert but later cancels for a qualifying reason, the Recspert will get an automatic refund.
The Recspert paid for the same lead twice. A Recspert shouldn&rsquo;t pay twice for the same lead. If A Recspert receives another Lead from the same customer (with identical opportunity details) within 7 days of each other, we automatically credit the cost of the second Lead back to your Account.</p><p>b. Case-by-case refunds</p><p>For all other circumstances, we require a review of the situation before a refund decision can be made. We review the reason for your dispute and the details you submit with your request. We don’t give refunds based on performance or return on investment. Any refunds must be requested by emailing <a href=mailto:support@recspert.com>support@recspert.com</a> within thirty (30) days of the charge. We might issue a refund for the following situations:
The project changed significantly. If a Customer contacts you about an opportunity that’s drastically different from the original Lead (for example, the Customer changes the location, and it&rsquo;s outside of your travel area), let us know what changed when you request a refund.</p><p>The opportunity is unreasonable. If you were contacted by a Customer who needs something you can&rsquo;t reasonably accommodate or do, you may request a refund.</p><p>The Customer’s first contact is “no thanks.” When you reach out to Customers, we don&rsquo;t think it’s fair for you to pay if the Customer’s first response back to you is a clear no. But if you were charged for this situation, request a refund and we&rsquo;ll look into it.</p><p>A Lead violates our Terms of Use. We do our best to make sure all Leads meet our terms and guidelines. If you get a Lead that doesn’t meet these Terms of Use, please report the Customer to request a refund.</p><p>The opportunity takes place outside of your availability. Let’s say a Customer contacts you with an opportunity on a specific date. If you&rsquo;ve blocked off that date on both your calendar and business hours, request a refund.</p><p>The Customer provided an invalid phone number. If you have any issues with a contacting a Customer, request a refund and we’ll look into it. In your request, let us know why you believe the phone number is invalid. While we may refund for fake phone numbers, we’re not able to refund for non-responsive Customers.</p><p>c. One-time courtesy credit</p><p>We know there are situations that fall outside of our refund policy that may still deserve a closer look by our team. So, to improve your experience, we offer Recsperts a one-time courtesy credit for certain situations. We review the reason for the dispute and the details submitted with the request. We don’t give refunds based on performance or return on investment. Any refunds must be requested within thirty (30) days of the charge. We might issue a one-time courtesy credit to a Recspert’s Account for the following situations:</p><p>• It’s a Recspert’s first time requesting a refund.

Reasons a refund might not be available</p><p>We don’t offer refunds in these cases:
