Do you want to build agility at your home? Are you tired of training and exercises that require expensive equipment? This blog post will show you some agility and quickness drills you can do at home.

Agility is the general ability to change direction when moving quickly and efficiently, all while maintaining proper posture and movement mechanics.

Therefore, agility training involves a range of exercises designed to improve your ability to change directions during movement.

When it comes to measuring improvements in agility, if you can run forward, side shuffle, backpedal, and reaccelerate faster than before, your agility has improved.

For general fitness, when compared with inactivity, agility training improves a range of physical performance metrics including:

* lower and upper body strength
* lower body and trunk explosive power
* walking mechanics and endurance
* balance
* mobility

Either way, agility exercises are a great way to improve your overall physical fitness and coordination.

## They’re also a lot of fun! Here are some easy ones you can try at home:
1) Balance on one foot while holding an object above your head (a book works well). Try it with each hand as well. Reverse directions every other minute.

2) Jump up and down while touching your toes (or as high as possible). Repeat 50 times, then switch to jumping up onto a step stool or bench every other minute for 30 seconds each time.

3) Do pushups against a wall (make sure your back is straight), then turn around so that your feet are against the wall and your hands are in front of you — do pushups with your feet against the wall instead of your hands! Repeat 10 times per side, then switch sides every other minute.

Depending on your level and the equipment available, you can add one or several agility drills to your fitness routine, or perform an entire workout comprising agility exercises.

Whether you’re a general fitness enthusiast or a competitive athlete, agility drills are a key component of a great training routine.

Agility exercises are a great way to stay fit and have fun at the same time. There are many different exercises you can try, and you can even do them at home. If you enjoyed this article, please like, follow, share, and comment.
