# How to practice relaxation

Relaxation can be practiced in isolation or at the end of yoga practice. It is usually done between 10 and 15 minutes, although it can be extended as long as needed.

There are many relaxation techniques and they all have the same goal: release tension and restore balance to the body and mind.

The act of relaxing is not an effort, on the contrary, the act of letting go, of abandoning oneself, is implicit in it.

The common thread of relaxation is breathing. Slow, conscious, natural, and silent breathing.

For some it is difficult. I remember a pregnant student, who once expressed to me her discomfort to remain motionless during relaxation. She recognized that it was a difficult time for her. She had difficulty closing her eyes and letting go of her body. In fact, she took advantage of those minutes to go over her to-do list.

Other people express a desire to flee. It is more common than we think. We live in a frenetic activity and the mere fact of stopping is a great challenge.

Can you learn to let go? Yes. It just takes time and patience. It’s a matter of practice.

## **Savasana: a yoga posture for relaxation**
Savasana translates as Corpse Pose. The Sanskrit word “Sava” means corpse and “asana” means posture, hence the meaning: corpse posture.

In the practice of yoga, it is very important to observe ourselves and become aware of our posture. If we bring our attention to all the asanas we perform, why not also observe the position of our body in the savasana?

## **Indications for adopting the posture of savasana**
First, place a folded blanket at head height. To get into this asana you need to sit on your buttocks with your legs bent. The flexed arms are placed behind the lower back and the hands are placed on the ground (fingers towards the buttocks).

Little by little, the torso falls backward, pulling the buttocks down (facilitating the support of the lower back), and rests on the blanket.

Place your legs a little apart, and your heels flat on the floor, feeling them fall slightly outward, toward your little toes.

Let your arms rest along the body, slightly apart from the body. Surrender to the asana, leaving the palms of your hands facing up. Loose fingers.

In savasana, we release the body without controlling our breath. We distance ourselves from thoughts. Keeping us present at all times.

The primary goal is to calm the body, but the ultimate goal is to quiet the mind.

Master BKS Iyengar used to say that this apparently easy posture is one of the most difficult to master.

## **Relaxation tips**
Choose a quiet place, with dim light and a comfortable temperature. And keep a blanket handy. When we relax the body, our body temperature drops considerably.

It is very important that you place a folded blanket under your head (leave your cervicals free). This will prevent you from keeping your chin up and rolling your eyes back. When the eyes (they are intimately connected to the nervous system) go backward, we invite the mind to wander in thoughts.

There is also the possibility of placing a bag of aromatic herbs over the eyes or a band. In this way, greater insulation from the outside is achieved.

**The three levels of relaxation**
3 levels of relaxation can be achieved:

**Physical relaxation:** attention is brought to the body. Brief muscle contractions occur that allow you to become aware of the tensions in the body. The brain sends signals to the muscles to relax.

**Mental relaxation:** Slow and regular breathing, without effort, is proposed as a means of achieving mental relaxation. We let go of any control, we focus on the present moment, letting go of any problem or concern. Little by little our thoughts calm down.

**Spiritual relaxation:** it is a deeper state. Very close to sleep and in which the notion of time and space is lost. Allows deep regeneration.
Now that you learn another technique to relax, is time to take a time to practice.
