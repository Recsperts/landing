## *“If you watch a game, it’s fun. If you play at it, it’s recreation. If you work at it, it’s golf.” ‒ Bob Hope* 

⛳️Why golf has become so popular?

 Golf is no longer an old man’s game! Recently golf has become the ultimate summer sp
ort — largely thanks to its social distancing-friendly style of play. One thing to understand about golf is that it’s not just about the game on the course. A full round of golf can take more than 4 hours to complete, so it can quickly become an all-day activity. Golf is played at an enjoyable pace that allows you to embrace the beautiful scenery, soak up the sun, and leaves room for conversation — frequent waiting periods allow a party to engage in meaningful discussions (over a glass of wine 🍷 🤔)
⛳️ It’s more than just a sport, it’s a social event!
Golf is a family-friendly form of recreation. Country clubs and golf courses offer off-course entertainment like restaurants, bars, hotels, and spas that the whole family can enjoy. What is most important to highlight is that golf is accessible to all age groups allowing golfers to enjoy rounds with the oldest and the youngest members of their family. Golf carts are a great alternative to those who do not want to walk, and forward tee boxes ensure that children and older folks can play at a reasonable distance.
