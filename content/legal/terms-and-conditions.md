4.4  Refund Policy.  Customer subscription fees paid are nonrefundable. For Recsperts, refunds for certain situations are automatically given, and others are given on a case-by-case basis. All case-by-case refunds are made at Company’s sole discretion in light of the circumstances. Refunds will be returned to your Company balance, not to your original form of payment. Points packages are not refundable, but individual Leads purchased with points can be disputed and if approved, will be credited to your Account balance.
a. Automatic refunds

In some circumstances, we will automatically issue a refund back to a Recspert’s Account. The Recspert doesn't need to contact us or request a refund for these. They include: 

Booking protection. if a Customer books a Recspert but later cancels for a qualifying reason, the Recspert will get an automatic refund.
The Recspert paid for the same lead twice. A Recspert shouldn't pay twice for the same lead. If A Recspert receives another Lead from the same customer (with identical opportunity details) within 7 days of each other, we automatically credit the cost of the second Lead back to your Account. 

b. Case-by-case refunds

For all other circumstances, we require a review of the situation before a refund decision can be made. We review the reason for your dispute and the details you submit with your request. We don’t give refunds based on performance or return on investment. Any refunds must be requested by emailing support@recspert.com within thirty (30) days of the charge. We might issue a refund for the following situations: 
The project changed significantly. If a Customer contacts you about an opportunity that’s drastically different from the original Lead (for example, the Customer changes the location, and it's outside of your travel area), let us know what changed when you request a refund.

The opportunity is unreasonable. If you were contacted by a Customer who needs something you can't reasonably accommodate or do, you may request a refund.

The Customer’s first contact is “no thanks.” When you reach out to Customers, we don't think it’s fair for you to pay if the Customer’s first response back to you is a clear no. But if you were charged for this situation, request a refund and we'll look into it.

A Lead violates our Terms of Use. We do our best to make sure all Leads meet our terms and guidelines. If you get a Lead that doesn’t meet these Terms of Use, please report the Customer to request a refund.

The opportunity takes place outside of your availability. Let’s say a Customer contacts you with an opportunity on a specific date. If you've blocked off that date on both your calendar and business hours, request a refund.

The Customer provided an invalid phone number. If you have any issues with a contacting a Customer, request a refund and we’ll look into it. In your request, let us know why you believe the phone number is invalid. While we may refund for fake phone numbers, we’re not able to refund for non-responsive Customers.

c. One-time courtesy credit

We know there are situations that fall outside of our refund policy that may still deserve a closer look by our team. So, to improve your experience, we offer Recsperts a one-time courtesy credit for certain situations. We review the reason for the dispute and the details submitted with the request. We don’t give refunds based on performance or return on investment. Any refunds must be requested within thirty (30) days of the charge. We might issue a one-time courtesy credit to a Recspert’s Account for the following situations: 

•	It’s a Recspert’s first time requesting a refund. Recsperts may be able to get a courtesy credit the first time a Recspert has a charge dispute. This is only valid for new Recsperts learning how the Website and Services works.

•	A Recspert preferences aren’t set up quite right. A one-time courtesy credit may be given if a Recspert’s preferences weren’t set up correctly and the Recspert charged for a Lead that matches them. Recsperts can contact at support@recspert.com to learn how to update their ] preferences so Recsperts can target the right Leads going forward.

d. Reasons a refund might not be available

We don’t offer refunds in these cases:
•	Intent to hire, get a quote, or move on to the next step in the process was demonstrated from either the Customer or Recspert. For example, the Customer asked a Recspert to call to discuss the opportunity or the Recspert sent the Customer a link to their business website.
•	The basic requirements to use the Website or Services pursuant to these Terms of Use are not met.
•	There’s insufficient information to support the refund request.
•	The refund is requested more than thirty (30) days after the charge.

e. Company performance

We can’t guarantee your profile will reach its intended audience or achieve the best outcome in every instance. We don’t give refunds based on performance or return on investment. 

f. Processing time

Refunds typically take 1 to 2 business days to process, depending on the details of the case. It may take up to 3 to 5 business days to resolve a refund needing further review.

g. Closing your Recspert Account
