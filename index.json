During this time, you need to step up the workout routine and keep your stress levels under control.\nyoga christmas You don’t want to end up feeling sick, or worse! To help you keep your body and mind healthy during the holidays, here are some tips:\n1. Make sure you get enough sleep. Getting enough sleep is one of the most important steps to maintaining good physical and mental health during the holiday season. Sleep helps us to stay energized and alert, and is essential for our overall wellness. It also helps to regulate our mood and gives us a sense of well-being. The holidays can be a hectic time, and it can be difficult to get the recommended 7–9 hours of sleep per night. To make sure you are getting enough restful sleep, establish a regular bedtime routine, turn off all screens and gadgets at least an hour before bed, and avoid eating or drinking anything caffeinated in the afternoon or evening.\n2. Eat healthily. Eating healthy foods and getting enough water is an important component of maintaining your physical and mental well-being during the holidays. Eating a balanced diet full of nutrient-rich foods will help you stay energized and focused throughout the season. Aim to incorporate plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables into your daily diet for added vitamins and minerals. You can also focus on incorporating lean proteins, whole grains, and dairy products. Eating foods that are high in healthy fats and antioxidants, like fish, nuts, and avocado can also be beneficial for your overall wellness. Taking small steps to improve your diet now can have a lasting impact on your health. By focusing on eating healthier foods, you can help create a healthier lifestyle for yourself that can be sustained long after the holiday season is over. Make sure to check in with yourself regularly to monitor how your dietary choices are affecting your physical and mental health. Eating well is essential for managing stress, boosting your immunity, and improving your overall wellness.\n3. Don’t forget about exercise, exercising during the holiday season is an important way to maintain your health and well-being. Exercise can help keep your body strong, improve your mood, and reduce stress. It can also help you sleep better and boost your energy levels. There are many ways to get in your daily exercise during the holidays. Going for a walk or jogging outside is a great way to enjoy the outdoors and get some physical activity. You could also try joining a local gym or fitness class. If you’re short on time, you can still get a good workout at home with online videos or apps. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the holidays, taking a break from physical activity can be beneficial. Just 15 minutes of exercise can help clear your head and improve your mental state. Exercising with friends or family can also be a great way to boost your motivation and have some quality time together. So don’t forget to make exercise a priority this holiday season!\n4. Take breaks, The holidays can be a busy and stressful time of year, but it’s important to take a break from all the hustle and bustle. Taking breaks throughout the day can help you stay focused, energized, and healthy. Schedule in some downtime for yourself each day, whether that means going for a walk, reading a book, or doing something creative. Make sure to take time to relax and enjoy the holiday season with friends and family. You don’t have to do it all — take a break, and focus on taking care of yourself.\n5. Avoid holiday stressors, The holidays are a time of joy and celebration, but the hustle and bustle of the season can take its toll on your mental and physical health. Taking steps to avoid holiday stressors can help you keep your mind and body healthy during this special time of year.\nOne way to avoid holiday stressors is to set realistic expectations for yourself and your family. Don’t overextend yourself by taking on too many tasks or activities. Know your limits and don’t be afraid to say no if you feel overwhelmed.\nIt can also be helpful to make sure you schedule some “me-time” into your routine, even if it’s just a few minutes each day. This can help you stay centered and relaxed so you can enjoy the holidays without getting too overwhelmed.\nOverloading ourselves can have an impact on our sleep patterns, our appetites (or lack of them), and our moods. Whether we’re jetting off to exotic locales and squeezing in last-minute parties with family, friends, and coworkers, or biting off more than we can chew in terms of shopping and decorating, the holidays often bring out the worst habits in us. And while there’s nothing wrong with looking forward to the joys that come along with the holiday season — making sure you’re physically and mentally prepared for it will make your experiences that much better.\n","permalink":"https://staging.recspert.com/blog/how-to-keep-a-healthy-mind-and-body-during-the-holidays/","summary":"Learn tips to help keep your body and mind healthy","title":"How To Keep A Healthy Mind and Body During The Holidays"},{"content":"Pickleball is one of the fastest-growing sports in the United States, and for good reason. It’s an incredibly fun and social game that can be played by people of all ages and skill levels. And, it’s a sport that can be enjoyed both indoors and outdoors. If you’ve never heard of pickleball, then you’re in for a treat. Keep reading to learn everything you need to know about this amazing sport, including why it’s the best sport you’ve never heard of!\nA sport for all the family The basic aim of pickleball, like with other racket sports, is to hit the ball over the net and prevent an opponent from hitting it back. It can be played in singles or doubles, inside or outside on a 20-foot by 44-foot court — approximately the size of a badminton court — and lasts until one side reaches 11 points, with a two-point cushion.\nPlaying pickleball allows you to work on your balance, agility, reflexes, and hand-eye coordination without putting excessive strain on your body. Pickleball is a wonderful alternative for older players who used to play tennis but have physical limitations such as hip, shoulder, knee, or other joint problems.\nPickleball is healthy Are you looking for great exercise for both your mind and body? Pickleball provides opportunities to work on balance, agility, reflexes, and hand-eye coordination without excessively straining your body. It’s an excellent choice for 50Plussers who played tennis previously but now have physical limitations.\nPickleball is easy to learn First, the rules are simple, and the paddles are large, making the ball fairly easy to hit with little practice. In under an hour, new players generally find themselves volleying back and forth over the net. With court dimensions less than half the size of a tennis court, your serves and returns don’t need to be precise for the ball to stay in play. It doesn’t take long to advance your skills with practice.\nPickleball is social Almost 60 percent of pickle ballers say they play for social reasons. Courts are small, so it’s easy to hold conversations while playing. The most popular way to play a game is with a partner against another team of two. Generally, there’s an opportunity for lots of interaction between players, even with strangers. It’s not uncommon for pickleball players to develop friendships or strengthen already existing bonds on the court.\nPickleball courts don’t require a lot of space The dimensions of a pickleball court are 20 ft by 40 ft. More players can enjoy games in smaller areas than what’s required for a tennis court. In fact, you can easily have two games going on at the same time on one tennis court. The small size also means less running for players. It’s still a good cardio workout, but not as much as sports with more sprints required to return the ball.\nPickleball is a fun game for all ages One of the beautiful things about pickleball is it is for everyone. People of all ages take up the game, from children strong enough to swing a paddle to older adults post-retirement. For this reason, pickleball is a popular family activity. As long as a doctor gives the OK to play, whether you are 15 or 75 you can play.\nPickleball is affordable For someone wanting to add exercise to their routine, pickleball is a fairly inexpensive way to go. Prices for paddles range widely, but for that just starting, you can find a decent paddle for less than $30 and a six-pack of balls for less than $10. There are no elaborate accessories involved– no shin guards, helmets, gloves, or anything other than your favorite pair of athletic shoes.\nPickleball is for all skill levels One of the reasons newbies enjoy pickleball is because it’s so easy to learn, especially if you ever played ping-pong, badminton, or tennis. And if you haven’t, no worries, you’ll pick it up.\nPickleball is highly contagious Pickleball is no longer a “new” sport or referred to as “up and coming”. People talk about it and invite their friends or join to make new ones. Many seem addicted after playing only a few times, for all the reasons listed above. Parks and recreation departments try to meet the demands of the public, building new pickleball courts or repurposing tennis courts for pickleball games. This fun game can be played indoors or out, so you can play in any type of weather.\nThe bottom line With so many reasons to play pickleball and few drawbacks, why not consider playing? It’s affordable, convenient, good exercise, gentle on the joints, fun, and offers great social opportunities! Not sure where to play?

This article addresses this and other questions about relaxation.\nSavasana is the best antidote to the stresses of modern civilization.\nB.K.S. Iyengar\nDo you need to relax? Do you find yourself overwhelmed by your pace of life? Well keep reading…\nHow to practice relaxation Relaxation can be practiced in isolation or at the end of yoga practice. It is usually done between 10 and 15 minutes, although it can be extended as long as needed.\nThere are many relaxation techniques and they all have the same goal: release tension and restore balance to the body and mind.\nThe act of relaxing is not an effort, on the contrary, the act of letting go, of abandoning oneself, is implicit in it.\nThe common thread of relaxation is breathing. Slow, conscious, natural, and silent breathing.\nFor some it is difficult. I remember a pregnant student, who once expressed to me her discomfort to remain motionless during relaxation. She recognized that it was a difficult time for her. She had difficulty closing her eyes and letting go of her body. In fact, she took advantage of those minutes to go over her to-do list.\nOther people express a desire to flee. It is more common than we think. We live in a frenetic activity and the mere fact of stopping is a great challenge.\nCan you learn to let go? Yes. It just takes time and patience. It’s a matter of practice.\nSavasana: a yoga posture for relaxation Savasana translates as Corpse Pose. The Sanskrit word “Sava” means corpse and “asana” means posture, hence the meaning: corpse posture.\nIn the practice of yoga, it is very important to observe ourselves and become aware of our posture. If we bring our attention to all the asanas we perform, why not also observe the position of our body in the savasana?\nIndications for adopting the posture of savasana First, place a folded blanket at head height. To get into this asana you need to sit on your buttocks with your legs bent. The flexed arms are placed behind the lower back and the hands are placed on the ground (fingers towards the buttocks).\nLittle by little, the torso falls backward, pulling the buttocks down (facilitating the support of the lower back), and rests on the blanket.\nPlace your legs a little apart, and your heels flat on the floor, feeling them fall slightly outward, toward your little toes.\nLet your arms rest along the body, slightly apart from the body. Surrender to the asana, leaving the palms of your hands facing up. Loose fingers.\nIn savasana, we release the body without controlling our breath. We distance ourselves from thoughts. Keeping us present at all times.\nThe primary goal is to calm the body, but the ultimate goal is to quiet the mind.\nMaster BKS Iyengar used to say that this apparently easy posture is one of the most difficult to master.\nRelaxation tips Choose a quiet place, with dim light and a comfortable temperature. And keep a blanket handy. When we relax the body, our body temperature drops considerably.\nIt is very important that you place a folded blanket under your head (leave your cervicals free). This will prevent you from keeping your chin up and rolling your eyes back. When the eyes (they are intimately connected to the nervous system) go backward, we invite the mind to wander in thoughts.\nThere is also the possibility of placing a bag of aromatic herbs over the eyes or a band. In this way, greater insulation from the outside is achieved.\nThe three levels of relaxation 3 levels of relaxation can be achieved:\nPhysical relaxation: attention is brought to the body. Brief muscle contractions occur that allow you to become aware of the tensions in the body. The brain sends signals to the muscles to relax.\nMental relaxation: Slow and regular breathing, without effort, is proposed as a means of achieving mental relaxation. We let go of any control, we focus on the present moment, letting go of any problem or concern. Little by little our thoughts calm down.\nSpiritual relaxation: it is a deeper state. Very close to sleep and in which the notion of time and space is lost. Allows deep regeneration. Now that you learn another technique to relax, is time to take a time to practice.\n","permalink":"https://staging.recspert.com/blog/learn-to-relax-savasana/","summary":"Learn to relax: Savasana","title":"Learn to relax: Savasana"},{"content":"","permalink":"https://staging.recspert.com/contact/","summary":"How can I help you?","title":"MEET THE TEAM"},{"content":"Header of my post !()[/upload/0b2966e8342db31a9d907bcf1bf93376.jpg]\n","permalink":"https://staging.recspert.com/blog/my-first-blog-post/","summary":"","title":"Title of my post"}]
