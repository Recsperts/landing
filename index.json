[{"content":"Now that the holidays have gone, we begin to phase into a new year â€” a time of new beginnings for many as resolutions are pledged and goalposts set in place. 2023 is the year you will hit your personal best, complete an obstacle course run, start eating healthier, and really just take care of yourself. We are here to help you out with some simple (and not-so-simple) ways for you to keep those fitness and wellness goals up!\nFamilies are busy, and their young athletesâ€™ schedules are packed with sports and school. However, one thing parents can do to help them improve their game this upcoming season is to talk about creating resolutions (or goals) with them for 2023. Goals setting helps set out a plan for whatâ€™s important and helps keep them focused. Having specific and attainable goals allows kids to feel a sense of achievement as they check them off throughout the year. Here are a few achievable resolutions you can try with your family.\nimageUrl: /images/1*6EY0xf0LY-6Rc4FFiNryoA.webp\n1. Set smart goals for the year. 2. Focus on nutrition and hydration. 3. Practice good sportsmanship. 4. Prioritize mental health. 5. Try new sports. As with most blog posts, we hope to give you plenty of information that may make your New Year healthier and more productive. We also hope to inspire you to try new things, you can also get in touch with some recreation experts at recspert.com, maybe itâ€™ll be something that lasts a few months, or maybe itâ€™ll be something more permanent in your life. Regardless, good luck and we wish you all the best in reaching your goals throughout this upcoming year!\n","permalink":"https://staging.recspert.com/blog/new-year-new-health-and-fitness-resolutions/","summary":"New Year, New Health \u0026 Fitness Resolutions","title":"New Year, New Health \u0026 Fitness Resolutions"},{"content":"Hugo ships with several Built-in Shortcodes for rich content, along with a Privacy Config and a set of Simple Shortcodes that enable static and no-JS versions of various social media embeds.\nYouTube Privacy Enhanced Shortcode Twitter Simple Shortcode When dealing with strings and javascript variables, template literals help in writing cleaner code.#webdevelopment #programming pic.twitter.com/Vr1TBDoDFe\n\u0026mdash; Heksagon (@Heksagonnet) January 28, 2022 Vimeo Simple Shortcode ","permalink":"https://staging.recspert.com/blog/rich-content/","summary":"A brief description of Hugo Shortcodes","title":"Rich Content"},{"content":"Mathematical notation in a Hugo project can be enabled by using third party JavaScript libraries.\nIn this example we will be using KaTeX\nTo enable KaTex globally set the parameter math: true in a project\u0026rsquo;s configuration (config.yml) To enable KaTex on a per page basis include the parameter math: true in content files Note: Use the online reference of Supported TeX Functions\nExamples Inline math: \\(\\varphi = \\dfrac{1+\\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887â€¦\\) Block math:\n$$ \\varphi = 1+\\frac{1} {1+\\frac{1} {1+\\frac{1} {1+\\cdots} } } $$\n","permalink":"https://staging.recspert.com/blog/math-typesetting/","summary":"A brief guide to setup KaTeX","title":"Math Typesetting"},{"content":"Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways.\nThe emojify function can be called directly in templates or Inline Shortcodes.\nTo enable emoji globally, set enableEmoji to true in your site\u0026rsquo;s configuration and then you can type emoji shorthand codes directly in content files; e.g.\nðŸ™ˆ ðŸ™ˆ ðŸ™‰ ðŸ™‰ ðŸ™Š ðŸ™Š\nThe Emoji cheat sheet is a useful reference for emoji shorthand codes.\nN.B.
