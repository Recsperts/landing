Now that the holidays have gone, we begin to phase into a new year — a time of new beginnings for many as resolutions are pledged and goalposts set in place. 2023 is the year you will hit your personal best, complete an obstacle course run, start eating healthier, and really just take care of yourself. We are here to help you with some simple (and not-so-simple) ways to keep those fitness and wellness goals up!

Families are busy, and their young athletes’ schedules are packed with sports and school. However, one thing parents can do to help them improve their game this upcoming season is to talk about creating resolutions (or goals) with them for 2023. Goals setting helps set out a plan for what’s important and helps keep them focused. Having specific and attainable goals allows kids to feel a sense of achievement as they check them off throughout the year. Here are a few achievable resolutions you can try with your family.

# 1. Set smart goals for the year.

# 2. Focus on nutrition and hydration.

# 3. Practice good sportsmanship.

# 4. Prioritize mental health.

# 5. Try new sports.

As with most blog posts, we hope to give you plenty of information that may make your New Year healthier and more productive. We also hope to inspire you to try new things, you can also get in touch with some recreation experts at recspert.com, maybe it’ll be something that lasts a few months, or maybe it’ll be something more permanent in your life. Regardless, good luck and we wish you all the best in reaching your goals throughout this upcoming year!
