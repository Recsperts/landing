It’s an incredibly fun and social game that can be played by people of all ages and skill levels. And, it’s a sport that can be enjoyed both indoors and outdoors. If you’ve never heard of pickleball, then you’re in for a treat. Keep reading to learn everything you need to know about this amazing sport, including why it’s the best sport you’ve never heard of!\nA sport for all the family The basic aim of pickleball, like with other racket sports, is to hit the ball over the net and prevent an opponent from hitting it back. It can be played in singles or doubles, inside or outside on a 20-foot by 44-foot court — approximately the size of a badminton court — and lasts until one side reaches 11 points, with a two-point cushion.\nPlaying pickleball allows you to work on your balance, agility, reflexes, and hand-eye coordination without putting excessive strain on your body. Pickleball is a wonderful alternative for older players who used to play tennis but have physical limitations such as hip, shoulder, knee, or other joint problems.\nPickleball is healthy Are you looking for great exercise for both your mind and body? Pickleball provides opportunities to work on balance, agility, reflexes, and hand-eye coordination without excessively straining your body. It’s an excellent choice for 50Plussers who played tennis previously but now have physical limitations.\nPickleball is easy to learn First, the rules are simple, and the paddles are large, making the ball fairly easy to hit with little practice. In under an hour, new players generally find themselves volleying back and forth over the net. With court dimensions less than half the size of a tennis court, your serves and returns don’t need to be precise for the ball to stay in play. It doesn’t take long to advance your skills with practice.\nPickleball is social Almost 60 percent of pickle ballers say they play for social reasons. Courts are small, so it’s easy to hold conversations while playing. The most popular way to play a game is with a partner against another team of two. Generally, there’s an opportunity for lots of interaction between players, even with strangers. It’s not uncommon for pickleball players to develop friendships or strengthen already existing bonds on the court.\nPickleball courts don’t require a lot of space The dimensions of a pickleball court are 20 ft by 40 ft. More players can enjoy games in smaller areas than what’s required for a tennis court. In fact, you can easily have two games going on at the same time on one tennis court. The small size also means less running for players. It’s still a good cardio workout, but not as much as sports with more sprints required to return the ball.\nPickleball is a fun game for all ages One of the beautiful things about pickleball is it is for everyone. People of all ages take up the game, from children strong enough to swing a paddle to older adults post-retirement. For this reason, pickleball is a popular family activity. As long as a doctor gives the OK to play, whether you are 15 or 75 you can play.\nPickleball is affordable For someone wanting to add exercise to their routine, pickleball is a fairly inexpensive way to go. Prices for paddles range widely, but for that just starting, you can find a decent paddle for less than $30 and a six-pack of balls for less than $10. There are no elaborate accessories involved– no shin guards, helmets, gloves, or anything other than your favorite pair of athletic shoes.\nPickleball is for all skill levels One of the reasons newbies enjoy pickleball is because it’s so easy to learn, especially if you ever played ping-pong, badminton, or tennis. And if you haven’t, no worries, you’ll pick it up.\nPickleball is highly contagious Pickleball is no longer a “new” sport or referred to as “up and coming”. People talk about it and invite their friends or join to make new ones. Many seem addicted after playing only a few times, for all the reasons listed above. Parks and recreation departments try to meet the demands of the public, building new pickleball courts or repurposing tennis courts for pickleball games. This fun game can be played indoors or out, so you can play in any type of weather.\nThe bottom line With so many reasons to play pickleball and few drawbacks, why not consider playing? It’s affordable, convenient, good exercise, gentle on the joints, fun, and offers great social opportunities! Not sure where to play?
